# Flutter Crypto Wallet App UI Showcase

This is a sample Flutter app designed to showcase the UI for a cryptocurrency wallet app. The app demonstrates various features and UI components commonly found in cryptocurrency wallet applications. It features beautiful animations, portfolio tracking, and more.

## Introduction Page (intro_page.dart)

The `intro_page.dart` file contains the code for the introduction page, which users see when they first launch the app. It includes an engaging background image, a bold title, and a swipe-to-start button for a smooth user onboarding experience.

## Home Page (homepage.dart)

The `homepage.dart` file represents the main page of the app. It displays the user's wallet balance, offers options for sending, receiving, buying, and swapping cryptocurrencies, and showcases the user's portfolio of assets and a list of supported cryptocurrencies. The UI is clean, well-organized, and aesthetically pleasing.

## Static Page (static_page.dart)

The `static_page.dart` file is similar to the home page, showcasing the UI for the app. It includes features such as the user's wallet balance, options for sending, receiving, buying, and swapping cryptocurrencies, and a portfolio view. The UI follows a minimalistic design approach and is visually appealing.

The Flutter app utilizes various packages like `animate_do`, `auto_animated`, and `slide_to_act` to provide smooth animations and interactive components for a seamless user experience. The UI elements are styled using a custom theme with carefully chosen colors and fonts.
